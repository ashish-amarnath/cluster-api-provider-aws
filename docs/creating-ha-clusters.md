# Creating Clusters With HA Control Plane  <!-- omit in toc -->
Currently clusterctl supports creating clusters with a single instance controlplane. This document outlines the steps for standing up an cluster with an HA controlplane.

## Prerequisites
### Creating cluster with single instance controlplane.
Following the [getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md), please setup a cluster with a single control plane instance.

## Growing controlplane into HA controlplane.
At this point, a cluster with a single instance control plane has been created and is responding to `kubectl`. Please refer to the 'Using the Cluster' section of the [getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md) for instructions. If you are unable to run `kubectl` against the cluster, please follow the 'Troubleshooting' section of the [getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md) to resolve the problem. 

Now, that the cluster with the single instnace control plane has been created, more controlplane instances can be added by creating machine objects for each desired controlplane machine. The following steps are for adding two control plane machines.
1. Copy the following yaml into a file, say `controlplane-machines.yaml`, and update the names for the new controlplane machines.
```bash
apiVersion: "cluster.k8s.io/v1alpha1"
kind: MachineList
items:
  - apiVersion: "cluster.k8s.io/v1alpha1"
    kind: Machine
    metadata:
      name: <UPDATE_WITH_NEW_CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_NAME>
      labels:
        set: controlplane
    spec:
      versions:
        kubelet: v1.13.2
        controlPlane: v1.13.2
      providerSpec:
        value:
          apiVersion: awsprovider/v1alpha1
          kind: AWSMachineProviderSpec
          instanceType: "t2.medium"
          iamInstanceProfile: "control-plane.cluster-api-provider-aws.sigs.k8s.io"
          keyName: "cluster-api-provider-aws.sigs.k8s.io"
  - apiVersion: "cluster.k8s.io/v1alpha1"
    kind: Machine
    metadata:
      name: <UPDATE_WITH_NEW_CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_NAME>
      labels:
        set: controlplane
    spec:
      versions:
        kubelet: v1.13.2
        controlPlane: v1.13.2
      providerSpec:
        value:
          apiVersion: awsprovider/v1alpha1
          kind: AWSMachineProviderSpec
          instanceType: "t2.medium"
          iamInstanceProfile: "control-plane.cluster-api-provider-aws.sigs.k8s.io"
          keyName: "cluster-api-provider-aws.sigs.k8s.io"
```
*Pro tip* ðŸ’¡: You may refer to the existing controlplane machine's yaml to create the above yaml for yourself.
2. Create the machine objects, alongside other machines of the cluster, by applying the yaml file, `controlplane-machines.yaml`, from above.
```bash
kubectl apply -f controlplane-machines.yaml
``` 
Note: You may have to use the `-n <NAMESPACE>` option to kubectl incase your cluster and machines were created in the non-default namespace.

3. This step is optional. Watch these newly created machine objects being reconciled by following the logs from the `aws-provider-controller-manager-0` pod using the below command
```bash
kubectl -n aws-provider-system logs -f aws-provider-controller-manager-0
```
Additionally, view the new instances initializing in the AWS console.

4. Once the machine objects have been reconciled and the instances in AWS have been created and initialized, `kubectl get no` should show the two new machines with master roles.

Just like that you have now transformed your cluster from a single instance controlplane to one with an HA controlplane. ðŸŽ‰

## Troubleshooting
### Instances for the new machines not getting created
Inspect the logs from the `aws-provider-controller-manager-0` pod to determine why the controlplane is unable to create the necessary resources. Follow the logs from the `aws-provider-controller-manager-0` pod using the command below:
```bash
kubectl -n aws-provider-system logs -f aws-provider-controller-manager-0
```
### Instances were created and initialized, but nodes don't show up on running 'kubectl get no'
Insepect the system log on the newly created instances for information about why this instance failed to join the existing controlplane. Instructions on how to view the system log is available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-console.html)
